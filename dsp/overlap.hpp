 * @brief Overlapping functions -- convolution and correlation of signals.
 *
 *        Convolution and correlation, while not related, have far too similar a
 *        kernel to warrant factoring into separate implementations; convolution can
 *        be done with a reverse iterator over the signal while correlation can be done
 *        with a forward iterator. We'll let the compiler work out how best to implement.
 *
 *        Note that all of these functions are destructive -- they'll overwrite the
 *        LHS operand of the convolution/correlation operator.

/**
 * @brief Enumeration of the modes supported by the overlapping.
 *
 *        For Full and Same modes, padding will be added to the signal
 *        to accommodate filter delay. Valid is the only mode which
 *        won't resize the signal container. It's recommended to
 *        initialise the signal container with the appropriate padding
 *        and use the Valid mode if performance is required. If Full
 *        or Same are chosen, the signal container must support an
 *        insert method.
 *
 * @param Full Include the filter delay in the overlap.
 * @param Valid No boundary effects from the filter delay.
 * @param Same Bounday effect at the end.
